Read and follow the instruction carefully. 

The Prescreen ASVAB can be used to predict how well you will do on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB). 

For your score to be accurate, you should be well rested when you take the test, try your best on the test, and take the test in a quiet place and without interruptions. You should try to finish the test without stopping. It takes most people about 2 hours or less to complete all parts of the test. 

You should not look up answers to test questions or obtain answers from others as your final score will NOT be representative of your ASVAB score. Use only your knowledge to answer the questions - do not use unauthorized assistance. As you take the test, you should have a pencil and scratch paper in front of you for any figuring you need to do. Any other materials should NOT be used, including reference books, internet sources, a calculator and other such help. 

 

To take the Prescreen ASVAB, use Internet Explorer to go to the following web address:
